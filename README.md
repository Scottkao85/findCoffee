#Find Coffee and Study Area

##What is it:
-my first programming project: used Google Maps API, some basic Bootstrap CSS

##Purpose:
-the app will show users' current location(the grumpy cat) and its nearby coffee shops.
Users can either click on the markers on the map or store name to see highlighted route to the destination
